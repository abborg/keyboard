Began developing the idea for a custom built keyboard about 2 years ago. Learned how to use Sketchup and Eagle to build off of Jack Humbert's [Atomic keyboard](www.ortholinearkeyboards.com/atomic). Designed a layout that I liked over the course of two years before deciding on a 5u by 14u form factor. Decided to switch from Eagle and Sketchup to AutoCAD and KiCad because they had better features for what I wanted to do. Since then, continued to develop the PCB for the keyboard as well as the case.
