Keyboard
========

This repository is dedicated to information and the process of constructing my own custom mechanical keyboard. The hope is that this will be used to store my own notes and layout for future use or modification.

##Layout  

The layout is a unique design I have developed after studying other popular layouts. It has yet to be tested and will require a fair amount of getting used to compared to other layouts. It attempts to utilize the Workman layout and reduce the size of modifier keys. The layout was designed with intuition in mind. As such, much of the layout is symmetrical in an attempt to provide a regular structure to the placement of non-alphabet keys. The idea behind this is that one can make a good guess of where a symbol key is based upon the location of similar keys. Working with a keyboard with access to the microcontroller allows for the layout to be adjusted to suite the needs of the user.
